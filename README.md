ASP.NET-Dicey
=============

Crime compendium with Search, Add, Edit and Delete functionality built with ASP.ADO - SQL 2012

I wanted to track all the crime shows I watch online so I whipped up a little something to do that.
Home page allows you to enter the URL of a show and search the database. If you have seen it before
it will display on the home page. If not, enjoy the show! Then add the URL and the information.
Later you can edit, delete and view a history list of all the shows watched.

This was done using ADO.NET with a simple repeater and ItemTemplate. I used my local copy of 
SQL Server 2012 for the database.
